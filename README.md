Wouldn’t it be great to find podcasts that discuss exactly what you are interested in at the moment? Or even better, to find the exact part of the podcast that discusses your topic of interest?  The task is to:

1. Use Elasticsearch (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) to index the transcriptions of the podcasts (You will obtain this data from Johan).

2.  Create an interface where a user can enter a search query, e.g. “Higgs Boson”, “terrorism” or “what Jesus means to me”, to find and rank n-minute clips from podcasts that treat this subject (e.g 2-minute-clips, or n can be selectable).

3.  The relevant portions of the transcriptions of the clips can be shown as search results.

This task is inspired by the TREC 2020 podcasts track, task 1. More information on: https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/trec-2020-podcasts-track-guidelines
